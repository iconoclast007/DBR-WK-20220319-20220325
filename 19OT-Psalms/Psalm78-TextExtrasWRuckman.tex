Almost every Psalm smacks of the persecution of Israel during Daniel’s Seventieth Week, and their desperate need for divine intervention at that time. The Advent is described over and over again. This Psalm is no exception. Verses 1--3 are unmistakable. Asaph is prophesying four hundred years ahead of schedule. He has caught up with Jeremiah 39 and Lamentations 2--5 and, consequently, has walked right into the Tribulation again. The Asaph of David and Solomon’s time certainly does not live to see the temple “defiled” or Jerusalem “laid...on heaps.” No blood is “shed like water round about Jerusalem” during David’s life or Solomon’s life. Asaph is prophesying. “The heathen” are Europeans (Ezek. 38:2), Asiatics (Rev. 16:12), and Africans (Ezek. 38:5). “Thy holy temple” was defiled in 586 B.C. under Nebuchadnezzar, and was defiled again under Antiochus Ephiphanes, and again in A.D. 70 under Titus; it will be defiled again (Matt. 24) in the Tribulation. Having been led from Dan to Beersheba by Psalm 78:60, 67, Spurgeon, at this point, decides to disappear into the great Arabian desert. He writes two pages describing what Asaph already describes, and then says that Asaph was an “eyewitness” of what took place. To make sure that no prophetic element can be found anywhere in the Psalm, Spurgeon erases all of the prophesies and has them fulfilled BEFORE Solomon builds the temple. This time even Kroll can exposit intelligently —for a few minutes. He recognizes the primary applications are to Jeremiah 9, 26, 52, and Micah 3. Even Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown can find the historical references, but as Kroll, they miss all of the future prophetic references. Spurgeon cuts the Holy Spirit out in 1000 B.C., whereas Kroll, Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown cut Him out in 586 B.C. Six of one; half a dozen of another. Everything between verse 1 and verse 6 will happen again in the near future. All of the commentators miss this truth, so none of them make any comment on it.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

The prayer is answered (see Rev. 6, 14, 16, 19; Isa. 9, 63; Jer. 25:15--27). “Upon the kingdoms that have not called upon thy name.” No kingdom in the United Nations General Assembly is allowed to “call upon His name.” The name of “Jesus Christ” is verboten not only in the classrooms of the middle schools and the high schools of America (except as a cuss word), but no prayer in the UN can be closed in that name, nor can that name be called upon at any football, baseball, or basketball game in America--except as a cuss word. The  America of the twenty-first century is NOT the America that our forefathers founded. It is a humanistic, mongrel mass of one world pragmatists who have no use for the Bible or God anywhere in public life, foreign policy, race relations, criminal cases, economic decisions, public education, entertainment, or family matters. “For they have devoured Jacob.” Literally, as well as figuratively (see Jer. 51:34; Ps. 14:4, 53:4; and Isa. 6:13). All the commentators miss all the references. S.O.P. Devotionally, we may say “if any man defile the temple of God, him shall God destroy”  (1 Cor. 3:17), and agnostics and deists (vs. 6) are in the same boat. Note that these two classes are found again in 2 Thessalonians 1:8 and Zephaniah 1:6. Knowing God (Rom. 1:19--21) or “believing in God” (James 2:19)  doesn’t make a man God’s friend or make God man’s friend. The “Friend of God” (James 2:23) obeyed God. Knowledge of God (“theology”) condemns a man if he refuses to believe God or obey God. All Fundamentalists (including demon-possessed Fundamentalists: Mark 1:24, 5:7; Acts 16:17, etc.) “believe in God”; they just don’t believe what God said (Gen. 3:1).\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

The “iniquities” of verse 8 are taken away at the Second Advent (Rom. 11:26; Acts 3:19--20), and not before then (Isa. 40:2). At this time, Israel’s sins are “purged away” (vs. 9) according to Jeremiah 33:8, 50:20, and Ezekiel 37:23, and at this time the “revenging of the blood” of the Israelites takes place (see Deut. 32:42 and Rev. 6:10). There is not one difficult or obscure thing in either verse. Both verses are literal and will be fulfilled literally after 2002. Jamieson, Fausset, and Brown can’t do anything with them. After citing Deuteronomy 32:13 and Joel 2:32 (for vs. 10), they can make no application. The muddled incoherency of Liberty University is a marvel to behold. With the restoration of Israel, spiritually (Heb. 8; Ezek. 36:24–28, Rom. 11), fulfilled right in front of Jerry Falwell’s face, his long tenure Alexandrians can only blubber “The psalmist now masterfully pleads for God to do three things in behalf of his people...He recognizes the sin of his people and confesses it as such. His concern is that the name of God would be blasphemed among the heathen if Jehovah did not rescue His own.”
\begin{compactenum}
\item He does NOT rescue “His own” (Lam. 2--5).
\item The enemy DOES blaspheme His name (Psa. 74:10; Rev. 13:6; 2 Kings 19:3).
\item And 1,040 years after this is written Paul compels Israelites to blaspheme “His name” (Acts 26:11).
\end{compactenum} 
Someone at Liberty University doesn’t have the spiritual discernment of a clay pigeon. But then again, that is the price that any Nicolaitan must pay for trying to usurp the power of the Holy Spirit and the authority of the Book. After guessing that, historically, the Psalm was aimed at Nebuchadnezzar, Kroll cannot make one intelligent comment on anything in the Psalm doctrinally. But if you really want to see some depraved and reckless exhibits from the stupidity of higher Christian education, observe the NIV saying, “atone for our sins” (vs. 9), so you would think that Hebrews 8:10-–12 was fulfilled in Matthew 27. This is followed by the Living Bible (and the RSV and NRSV) saying “forgive us our sins”--when God forgave them clear through the Old Testament (Exod. 34:7) and even AFTER the Crucifixion (Luke 23:34; Acts 3:17). The  word “purge” was the needed word. It was erased from the Biblical text of the ASV, NASV, NIV, RSV, NRSV, and the New English Bible. This time the most corrupt reading of all is found in the Bible recommended by BBC, Truman Dollar, James Combs, Curtis Hutson, and Gary Hudson. This mutilated depravity says “provide atonement for our sins,” thus forcing you to think that the prayer of verse 9 was answered at Calvary. It wasn’t answered when Paul wrote Romans, and Romans 11:26 was written more than thirty years after Calvary. It is not answered until Acts 3:19--21, which refers to something that doesn’t happen until AFTER A.D. 2002. This was the scholarship of Arthur Farstad, Zane Hodges, Elmer Towns, Curtis Hutson, Truman Dollar, A. V. Henderson, Harold Ockenga, F. F. Bruce, and James Price. You couldn’t find a more blind bunch of guides if you joined the Sanhedrin in Christ’s day. They don’t know what they are reading, what they are studying, what they are teaching, or what they are writing or talking about. Verse 10 connected the “purging” with vengeance on the heathen. You are to believe --if you are superstitious enough to think that Curtis Hutson had a brain in his head--that at Calvary God revenged “the blood” of His servants. “His servants” (Rev. 6:10) do not show up until after A.D. 2002.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

Those who were “ready to die” (Ps. 88:15) dropped dead (Martin Gray, For Those I Loved; Stein, Treblinka; Rudoleph Hoess, Commandant of Auschwitz; Kogon, The Theory and Practise of Hell), and if they were fortunate they died immediately. No “greatness” of God’s “power” showed up one time in ten years (1935--1945), and no Israelite’s blood was “avenged” in any sense of the word. The “sevenfold” payment due to the Gentiles (vs. 12) and Israel’s “neighbours” (Ammon, Moab, and Edom; see Psa. 83:6--9) is out beyond 2002. Israel does not “shew forth thy praise to all generations” after Christ’s blood atonement;  not in any sense of the word, by the wildest light of the most vivid imagination. The reading of the New King Jimmy Version is a BLASPHEMY to the work and words of the Author of Scripture. No wonder Kroll can make no application. But as far as that goes, Baethgen bombs out with Briggs and Hupfeld; Davidson bombs out with Ewald and Hengstenberg; and they all wind up in the “landfill” with Dummelow, Motyer, Yates, Duhm, Hitzig, and DeWette. Nothing is more tragic and ridiculous than correctors of the King James Bible trying to “exposit” the “scriptures.”\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

They missed it. “Blessed are those who have nothing to say, and cannot be persuaded to say it.” There wasn’t one difficult verse in the entire Psalm, but since the entire Psalm had a doctrinal application to the future, the Scholar’s Union just busted their fool necks on it. We should not be surprised, for after all, none of them ever professed to have read “the Scriptures.” The Scriptures are “given by inspiration of God,” and since the first and main purpose for these “inspired Scriptures” was to teach DOCTRINE (2 Timothy 3:16), it is no wonder that the Alexandrian Cult misses the doctrinal references almost every time they show up.\cite{Ruckman1992Psalms}}

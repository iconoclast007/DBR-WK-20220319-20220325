\section{Psalm 80 Comments}

\subsection{Numeric  Nuggets}
Verses 2, and 6 have 13 unique words.  The phrase ``cause thy face to shine and we shall be saved'' is found 3 times in verses 3, 7, and 19, with the verses beginning with ``Turn us again.'' The three instances may be historically (and prophetically) indicative of three great deliverances of the people of Israel.
